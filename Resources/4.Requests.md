## **Testing Of the API**
 We are going to use the following python library to achieve the task
- Requests
 - [Requests Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
<!-- 2. Beautifulsoup4
- [beautofulsoup4 Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) -->
## **REQUESTS**
 ***

One of the main working of this application is to bring data or information from any API and display it to the user. The task of sending HTTP requests using Python is performed using the **Requests** Module. 

 The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, header, status, etc).

 The first step in using this module is to import it in the python file.

 ### Run the following command to install this library:
```
pip install requests
```
### To use the library you need to import the library: 
```
import requests
```
***
 #### Throughout this project we will be using various functions of **REQUESTS** library for fetching and sending data to server. 
 Here we are giving example of a simple get request. 
### GET:
A simple GET request can be made by REQUESTS library 
```
import requests

url = "http://httpbin.org"
r = requests.get('url')
r.status_code
```
here "r" is a Response object,all the information that a user request, will be provided through this object.

Now in the following peocess we can show the output/Response of the request.
```
print(r.status_code) # to print the status code of the response
print(r.text) # to print the raw response of the request
print(r.headers) # to print the header of the request
```

Similarly, You can explore other requests like, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
<!-- ### POST:
```
r = requests.post('url', data={'key': 'value'})
```
### PUT:
```
r = requests.put('url', data={'key': 'value'})
```
### PATCH:
```
r = requests.patch(url, params=param, auth=auth, headers=head, json=json)
 ``` -->
